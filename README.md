# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is my solution for the Odin Project's "Rock Paper Scissors" exercise. 

I didn't upload my solution for the first part of the exercise, so the first commit here is after completing part 2.

Also, I thought it would be more interesting to make the game a best-of-5 series instead of first to 5 wins. That doesn't follow the assignment exactly, but the logic is a little more complicated, so I figured it would be alright.
